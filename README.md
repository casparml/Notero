## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file
2. Upload all files to your web server
3. Customize the content to match your brand
4. Configure your server to display this page for 404 errors or as a temporary homepage

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/casparml/notero.git
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup
Simply modify the HTML content, update links, and replace the logo/images as needed.

### Customizing the Copyright Year
The auto-updating copyright year is handled by `copyright.js`. By default, it will show the current year, but you can specify a starting year:

```html
<footer>
  <span>Â© <span id="copyright"></span> Your Brand Name. All rights reserved.</span>
</footer>

<script src="includes/copyright.js"></script>
```

To change the starting year, open `includes/copyright.js` and update:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => updateCopyright(2022)); // Change to your desired start year
```

### Modifying Animations
The template uses ScrollReveal for animations. Modify `assets/js/style.js` to adjust animation settings.

## Browser Support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- IE 11+ (basic support)

## Dependencies
- BoxIcons for icon fonts
